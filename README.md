Summary
We wanted to look at the main causes of bee population decrease. As it currently stands, the sharp decrease of bees is a widely dabeated issue in terms of what is the "true" root of the issue. It has been narrowed down to the following factors: Pesticides, Pathogens, Parasites, and Climate. Initially we had planned to compare all factors and calculate which had the highest correlation to the decrease of  population. However, in order to keep within our given time frame wwe decided tozero in on the weather cahnges in relation to the population. It als had the best rand of data as well as many supporters saying it is the most likely cause.
