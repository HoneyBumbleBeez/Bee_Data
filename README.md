## Summary
We wanted to look at the main causes of bee population decrease. As it currently stands, the sharp decrease of bees is a widely dabeated issue in regarsd to what is the "true" root of the issue. It has been narrowed down to the following factors: Pesticides, Pathogens, Parasites, and Climate. Initially we had planned to compare all factors and calculate which had the highest correlation to the decrease of population. However, in order to keep within our given time frame we decided to solely zero in on the weather changes in relation to the population. It also had the best range of datasets availble to us.
